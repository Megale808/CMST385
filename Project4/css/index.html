                                    SiR, born Sir Darryl Farris on November 5, 1986, is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer from Inglewood, California. Known for his smooth vocals and soulful R&B sound, SiR is signed to Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), the same label as artists like Kendrick Lamar and SZA.

                                    SiR’s music often blends elements of neo-soul, jazz, and hip-hop, exploring themes of love, relationships, and personal growth. He gained recognition with projects like Seven Sundays (2015) and Her (2016), but his breakthrough came with the critically acclaimed albums November (2018) and Chasing Summer (2019). Popular songs include "D'Evils," "Hair Down" featuring Kendrick Lamar, and "John Redcorn."

                                    SiR's background in a musical family and experience as a vocal producer for artists like Jill Scott and Anita Baker have deeply influenced his artistry.
